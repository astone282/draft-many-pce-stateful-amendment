1.  Introduction

   The PCEP protocol has evolved from a stateless protocol [RFC5440] to
   a stateful protocol [RFC8231], incorporating numerous extensions.

   During interoperability testing it was observed that various
   implementations have implemented optimizations in the protocol.  This
   document serves to optimize the original procedure in [RFC8231] to
   optionally drop the PCReq and PCReply exchange, which greatly
   simplifies implementation and optimizes the protocol.

   In addition, [RFC8664] introduced extensions for Segment Routing and
   the encoding of segments in the ERO and RRO objects in PCEP.  This
   document serves as an update to [RFC8664] to permit the exclusion of
   the RRO object for Segment Routed paths.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Stateful Bringup

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2 allows delegation of an LSP in an
   operationally down state, but at the same time mandates the use of
   PCReq before sending PCRpt.  This document clarifies that sending
   PCReq is optional.

   The process of sending PCReq before PCRpt is referred to in this
   document as "stateless bringup".  In practice, stateless bringup
   introduces overhead and the PcRpt sent from PCC cannot be enforced by
   the PCE, because a stateless PCE is not required to maintain any per-
   LSP state about previous PCReq messages.  It has been observed that
   many implementations choose to ignore this requirement and send the
   PCRpt directly, without first sending a PCReq.  Although this
   behavior is not compliant with [RFC8231], it offers message
   processing advantages and simplifications.  As a result, this
   document updates [RFC8231].

   The adoption of stateful PCE does not eliminate the utility of
   stateless PCEP.  A characteristic of stateless PCEP is that PCReq
   messages does require altering the LSP path state information in the
   PCE.  As a result, PCReq messages can be used in scenarios such as
   OAM functions (e.g., ping and traceroute), where it is necessary to
   probe the network topology without impacting existing LSPs and LSP
   state management in the PCE.

2.1.  Updates to RFC 8231

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, says "The only explicit way for a PCC to
   request a path from the PCE is to send a PCReq message.  The PCRpt
   message MUST NOT be used by the PCC to attempt to request a path from
   the PCE."  This document updates [RFC8231] to remove the quoted text.

   As part of the new bringup procedure, the PCC MAY delegate an empty
   LSP (no ERO or empty ERO) to the PCE and then wait for the PCE to
   send a PCUpd, without first sending a PCReq.  This process is
   referred to as "stateful bringup".  The PCE MUST support the original
   stateless bringup for backward compatibility.  Supporting stateful
   bringup does not require introducing new behavior on the PCE, since,
   as previously noted, a PCE implementation is not required to modify
   LSP-DB state based on PCReq messages.  Therefore, regardless of
   whether a PCReq has been received, the PCE processes the PCRpt in the
   same manner.

   An example of stateful bringup follows.  In this example, the PCC
   starts by using an LSP-ID of 0.  The value 0 does not hold any
   special meaning; any other 16-bit value could have been used.

   PCC has no LSP yet, but wants to establish a path.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0,
   ERO={}).

         +=============+========================================+
         | TUNNEL      |                  LSP                   |
         +=============+========================================+
         | PLSP-ID=100 | OLSP-ID=0, D-flag=1, OPER=DOWN, ERO={} |
         +-------------+----------------------------------------+

               Table 1: Content of LSP DB after first PcRpt

   PCC received a PCUpd from the PCE and has decided to install the
   ERO={A} from that PCUpd.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-
   FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0, ERO={A}).

          +=============+======================================+
          | TUNNEL      |                 LSP                  |
          +=============+======================================+
          | PLSP-ID=100 | LSP-ID=0, D-flag=1, OPER=UP, ERO={A} |
          +-------------+--------------------------------------+

                  Table 2: Content of LSP DB after PcUpd

3.  Use of SR-RRO and SRv6-RRO objects

   [RFC8231] defines a PCRpt message which contains <intended-path>
   known as the ERO object and <actual-path> known as the RRO object.
   [RFC8664] defines SR-ERO and SR-RRO sub-objects for SR-TE LSPs.
   [RFC9603] further defines SRv6-ERO and SRv6-RRO sub-objects for
   SRv6-TE paths.

   In practice RRO data is the result of signalling via a protocol such
   as RSVP-TE, which allows collection of per-hop information along the
   path.  The ERO and RRO values may be different as the path encoded in
   the ERO may differ than the RRO such as during protection conditions
   or if the ERO contains loose hops which are expanded upon.  As
   Segment Routing LSP does not perform any signalling, the values of an
   SR-ERO/SRv6-ERO and SR-RRO/SRv6-RRO (respectively) are in practice
   the same, therefore some implementations have omitted the RRO when
   reporting a SR-TE LSP while others continue to send both ERO and RRO
   values.

   This document updates [RFC8664] by clarifying and relaxing
   requirement for both an ERO and RRO object to exist for SR-TE paths.
   If both ERO and RRO are present for the same LSP, it SHOULD be
   interpreted as the RRO being the actual path the LSP is taking but
   MAY interpret only the ERO as the actual path.  In the absence of RRO
   a PCE MUST interpret the ERO as the actual path for the LSP.  Until
   SR-TE introduces some form of signaling similar to RSVP-TE, the use
   of RRO is discouraged for SR-TE LSPs.
